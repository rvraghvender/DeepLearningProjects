        "Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory\". They can read input $x^{<t>}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remeber some contextual information through the hidden layer activation that get passed from one step to the next. This allows a unidirectional (one-way) RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidrectional (two-way) RNN can text context from both the past and the future, much like Marty McFly (Movie: Back to the Future)."
