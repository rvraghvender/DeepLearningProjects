# Neural Network and Deep Learning Projects
This repository contains several neural network and deep learning projects implemented using various frameworks and libraries. Each project is designed to explore different aspects of artificial intelligence and demonstrate the application of deep learning techniques.

## Projects
1. **Convolutional Neural Networks**     

    a). **Image classification** : This project focuses on image classification tasks using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  
    b). **Object Detection** : The object detection project focuses on detecting and localizing objects within images or videos.    
     It utilizes deep learning models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once). 
     The project provides code and pre-trained models for object detection tasks.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**      
In this project, natural language processing techniques are explored using deep learning models. 
It covers tasks such as sentiment analysis, text generation, and named entity recognition. 
Different architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and transformers are implemented for NLP tasks.


**Frameworks and Libraries**     
The projects in this repository are implemented using various deep learning frameworks and libraries, including:

TensorFlow    
Keras

Each project folder contains a README file with detailed instructions on setting up the environment and running the code.
